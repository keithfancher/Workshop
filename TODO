BASIC SHIT:
===========
* posting comment redirects to stupid page
    + should be able to redirect based on story that owns comment?
    + or provide a link on the posted.html template?
* sanitize user input
    + can use |linebreaks filter and sanitize HTML completely?
    + for stories, profiles should already be this way
* delete story
* lots of fucking tests
* search functionality

MORE SHIT:
==========
* pseudonyms
* some kind of categorization
* a "follow" system
* a "like" system?
* invite-only or private stories
* less ugly
* different revisions of one story?
    + for now can just use titles? makes for messy story list...
