BASIC SHIT:
===========
* login w/ email address, only "name" is pseudonym, no real name

* user can edit their first/last name on profile page
* lots of fucking tests
* search functionality
* author's note for a story -- put it in context, etc.
* list stories user has commented on in their profile (and author page?)


MORE SHIT:
==========
* bcrypt!
* upgrade to django 1.3, make sure it still works...
* use django message system?
* fancy JS form validation
* less ugly (find some boilerplate CSS, maybe?)

* markdown in stories and comments and such?
* pseudonyms
    + name display will flow pseudonym -> real name -> user name
    + if one doesn't exist fallback on the next
* "random story" functionality
* some kind of categorization
* a "follow" system
* a "like" system?
* invite-only or private stories
* different revisions of one story?
    + for now can just use titles? makes for messy story list...
* upload word docs directly and covert
    + using antiword?
    + convert to markdown, if I end up using markdown?
    + docx is basically XML, should be able to read that
    + or OOo Python scripting
    + or allow PDFs rather than .doc files
