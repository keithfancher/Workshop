BASIC SHIT:
===========
* user can edit their first/last name on profile page
* sanitize user input
    + can use |linebreaks filter and sanitize HTML completely?
    + for stories, profiles should already be this way
* delete story
* lots of fucking tests
* search functionality
* author's note for a story -- put it in context, etc.
* list stories user has commented on in their profile (and author page?)


MORE SHIT:
==========
* use django message system?
* fancy JS form validation
* less ugly (find some boilerplate CSS, maybe?)

* pseudonyms
    + name display will flow pseudonym -> real name -> user name
    + if one doesn't exist fallback on the next
* "random story" functionality
* some kind of categorization
* a "follow" system
* a "like" system?
* invite-only or private stories
* different revisions of one story?
    + for now can just use titles? makes for messy story list...
