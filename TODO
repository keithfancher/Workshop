BASIC SHIT:
===========
* search tests
* markdown tests
* list stories user has commented on in their profile (and author page?)
* documentation


MORE SHIT:
==========
* upgrade to django 1.3, make sure it still works...
* better/faster/stronger search
* password reset emails?
* use django message system?
* fancy JS form validation
* "random story" functionality
* some kind of categorization
* a "follow" system
* a "like" system?
* invite-only or private stories
* different revisions of one story?
    + for now can just use titles? makes for messy story list...
* upload word docs directly and covert
    + using antiword?
    + convert to markdown, if I end up using markdown?
    + docx is basically XML, should be able to read that
    + or OOo Python scripting
    + or allow PDFs rather than .doc files
