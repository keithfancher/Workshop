BASIC SHIT:
===========
* sanitize user input
    + can use |linebreaks filter and sanitize HTML completely?
    + for stories, profiles should already be this way
* delete story
* lots of fucking tests
* search functionality
* author's note for a story -- put it in context, etc.
* list stories user has commented on in their profile (and author page?)

MORE SHIT:
==========
* use django message system
* fancy JS form validation
* less ugly

* pseudonyms
* some kind of categorization
* a "follow" system
* a "like" system?
* invite-only or private stories
* different revisions of one story?
    + for now can just use titles? makes for messy story list...
